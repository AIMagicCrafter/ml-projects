# California Housing Price Prediction – Simple Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a **Simple Linear Regression** model using the **California Housing dataset** provided by `scikit-learn`. The goal is to predict the **median house value** based on **median income** in different districts of California.

---

## Project Objective

> To understand and implement Simple Linear Regression using one feature – **Median Income**, and evaluate its ability to predict the **Median House Price**.

---

## Dataset Details

- **Source**: `sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing`
- **Target**: Median House Value (in $100,000s)
- **Feature used**: Median Income (in $10,000s)

This is a clean, real-world dataset perfect for learning and practicing regression techniques.

## Libraries Used

- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

Install them using:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn matplotlib

```
